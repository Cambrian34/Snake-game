## Code Structure

### Classes

#### `Snake`
Represents the snake, including its position, size, and movement logic.

- **Attributes:**
  - `x`, `y`: Starting position.
  - `size`: Size of each segment.
  - `tail`: Array storing the snake's body segments.
  - `rotateX`, `rotateY`: Direction of movement.

- **Methods:**
  - `move()`: Updates the snake's position based on its direction.

#### `Apple`
Handles the apple's random placement, ensuring it doesn't spawn on the snake's body.

- **Attributes:**
  - `x`, `y`: Position.
  - `size`: Size of the apple.
  - `color`: Appearance.

### Core Functions

- `gameLoop()`: Starts the main game loop.
- `update()`: Updates game elements like snake movement and collision detection.
- `draw()`: Renders the game elements on the canvas.
- `checkHitWall()`: Wraps the snake around the canvas edges.
- `eatApple()`: Checks if the snake eats the apple and grows its tail.
- `createRect(x, y, width, height, color)`: Draws rectangles for game elements.

### Event Listeners

- `keydown`: Handles player input for movement, pausing, and restarting.

## Potential Improvements

1. **Game Over Mechanic:** End the game when the snake collides with itself.
2. **Difficulty Levels:** Increase speed as the score increases.
3. **Graphics Enhancements:** Add textures or animations.
4. **High Scores:** Track and display the top scores.
5. **Mobile Support:** Add touch controls for mobile devices.
